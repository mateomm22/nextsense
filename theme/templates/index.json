Always handle them gently and even if you're only swapping out wings, you’ll need to take the tip off first.<br/><br/><strong>Step 1:</strong> Remove the tip. Hold the earbud firmly in one hand. With the other hand, pinch the silicone tip near its base and pull it straight off using a slow, steady motion. Don’t twist or yank—these components are delicate and house important sensors.<br/><br/><strong>Step 2:</strong> Remove the wing. Gently peel the wing away from the body of the earbud, starting at one edge and working around. It should come off with light, even pressure—no need to force it.<br/><br/><strong>Step 3:</strong> Attach the new wing. Align the new wing so that the cutout fits neatly around the base of the earbud. Stretch the wing gently into place and press it down so it sits flush and snug against the earbud.<br/><br/><strong>Step 4:</strong> Attach the new tip.  Align the new tip with the nozzle of the earbud. Press it on firmly until it feels secure—you may hear or feel a soft click when it’s in place.</p>"

Setting it helps us customize your experience, like reminding you to charge your Smartbuds before bed. It doesn’t set an alarm or prevent you from starting a sleep session at a different time. Many users also find it helpful for setting sleep goals and keeping a consistent sleep schedule.</p>"
